## Bio
Hello! I'm a postdoctoral researcher at [the Institut für Statik und Dynamik](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/isd) in the Technical University of Braunschweig (TUBS), in Germany.
<!-- I'm also part of thel Resarch Training Group [ GRK 2075](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/grk-2075).   -->


**My research** focuses on the development of the <ins>Material Point Method (MPM)</ins>, a particle method useful for solving large deformation problems in solid and fluid mechanics, such as the simulation of granular flows, landslides, and avalanches. In fact, this technique was used to reproduce the snow in the animation for the [Frozen movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kyDKu8K-k).


Although my current research is primarily in engineering, I am not an engineer.

A few years ago, I studied mathematics at the University of Alicante in Spain. After completing my degree, I was an enthusiastic mathematician eager to specialize in applied mathematics. I pursued an additional Master's degree, which equipped me with expertise in mathematical modeling for the numerical simulation of physical phenomena. During my PhD at the Technical University of Catalunya (UPC), I worked on developing mathematical models to simulate <ins>viscoelastic flows</ins> with high elasticity.
Then I moved to the Department of Mathematics at the University of Padua in Italy as a postdoctoral researcher. There, I began working with MPM to study the numerical simulation of structures subjected to extreme natural phenomena.


I am also part of the [Kratos Multiphysics](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/Kratos) community as [developer](https://github.com/lauramoremar). Kratos is an open-source simulation software written in C++ and Python.

<!-- Finally I would also like to mention a **personal project** to which I dedicate my free time. I would like to point out that the gender gap in science, and in particular in engineering, is a fact today, as indicated by the [United Nations](https://www.un.org/en/un-chronicle/lack-gender-equality-science-everyone%E2%80%99s-problem#:~:text=According to%20UNESCO%20Science%20the%20percentage%20could%20be%20much%20higher%20). I believe that the **visibility** of historical women scientists is an important point to encourage girls to pursue careers in science, and in particular in engineering and mathematics. To this end, I manage the  instagram account named [Señoras de Ciencia](https://www.instagram.com/senyorasciencia/) (in spanish, sorry) with a lot of love, although I invest less time on it than I would like to. -->
