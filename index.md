I'm a **postdoctoral researcher** at the Department of Mathematics at the University of Padova (Italy) under the supervision of Prof. [Antonia Larese](https://www.math.unipd.it/~antonia/). This group is specialized on finite element methods and  particle-based methods.  I am working on the Material Point Method (MPM), a kind of particle method particularly suitable for simulating large deformation (non linear) problems. All my developments are implemented in the open-source and parallelized high performance environment [Kratos Multiphysics](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics)  code.  During this time, **my research**  focused on the development and implementation of the Variational Multiscale Method for stabilizing incompressible materials in solid and fluid mechanics problems, using the implicit MPM.

Regarding my background, I got my 5 years **M.Sc. in Mathematics**  by the  University of Alicante (UA), Spain, in 2013. After finishing it, I got an additional **Master in Industrial Mathematics**, by the University of Santiago de Compostela (USC), Spain.  This Master degree gave me both the fundamentals of the well-known Finite Element Method and the expertise on mathematical modelization for the numerical simulation of  several physical phenomena.  Moreover, I got a six months research position to participate in a research project  at the Department of Applied Mathematics.

In September 2016 I started as **doctoral student** in the Technical University of Catalunya (UPC), under the supervision of Prof. [Ramon Codina](https://deca.upc.edu/en/people/ramon.codina) and Prof. [Joan Baiges](https://sites.google.com/site/joanbaiges/home). I was also awarded with a predoctoral national scolarship. During my PhD I worked on the development of mathematical models and numerical methods to simulate viscoelastic flows with high elasticity. I presented [my thesis](https://www.tdx.cat/handle/10803/672679#page=1) on 22nd September 2021 achieving a qualification of *Excellent Cum Laude*.
