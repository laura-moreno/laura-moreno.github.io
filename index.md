My research consists in the development of mathematical models and numerical methods to achieve computational simulations with viscoelastic flows with elastic-turbulence, including thermal effects. These models are being implemented in a high performance computing environment, in order to make them usable for real applications, in particular for the evaluation and optimization of industrial processes in which non-isothermal viscoelastic fluid flows are involved.
