I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Mathematics of the University of Padova (Italy), working under the supervision of the Professor [Antonia Larese](https://www.math.unipd.it/~antonia/). My current research is about the Material Point Method (MPM), a kind of particle method particularly suitable for simulating water hazard events. All my developments are performed in the [Kratos Multiphysics](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics) code.

Regarding my background, I finished my 5 years M.S. in Mathematics in 2013, at University of Alicante (UA), Spain. While I was studying my degree, I really enjoyed the fields related to applied mathematics (EDOs, numerical methods, numerical calculus etc). For this reason, after finishing it, I decided to study the Master's degree in Industrial Mathematics, at University of Santiago de Compostela (USC), Spain. This Master degree gave me both the fundamentals of the well-known Finite Element Method and the expertise of mathematical modelization for simulating numerically several physical phenomena.

In September 2016 I started as a predoctoral student in the Polytechnic University of Catalunya (UPC), under the supervision of the Prof. [Ramon Codina](https://deca.upc.edu/en/people/ramon.codina) and the Prof. [Joan Baiges](https://sites.google.com/site/joanbaiges/home). These were around five years in which I worked in the development of mathematical models and numerical methods to achieve computational simulations with viscoelastic flows with high elasticity. Finally I presented [my thesis](https://www.tdx.cat/handle/10803/672679#page=1) on 22nd September 2021 achieving a qualification of *Excellent Cum Laude*.
