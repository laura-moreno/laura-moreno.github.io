Hello! My name is Laura Moreno Martínez and I'm a **postdoctoral researcher** at [the Institut für Statik und Dynamik](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/isd) in the Technical University of Braunschweig (TUBS), in Germany.
<!-- I'm also part of thel Resarch Training Group [ GRK 2075](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/grk-2075).   -->

**My research** here is focused on developments for the <ins>Material Point Method (MPM)</ins>, a particle method useful for solving large deformation problems in solid and fluid mechanics, such as the simulation of the movement of granullar flows, landslides or avalanches. In fact this technique was employed for reproducing the snow in the [Frozen movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kyDKu8K-k).

Although currently my research is mostly in engineering...  am not an engineer.
Some years ago I studied mathematics in Spain. After finishing the degree, I was a very entusiastic mathematician with the wish of specialising me in applied mathematics.  So I got an additional **Master**, which gave me the expertise on mathematical modelization for the numerical simulation of physical phenomena.  During **my PhD** in the Technical University of Catalunya (UPC) I worked on the development of mathematical models to simulate <ins>viscoelastic flows</ins> with high elasticity, a very delicate topic.  It was a challenge for me to tackle this problem, but I think that I do my bit.
Then I moved to the University of Padua (UNIPD), in Italy, as a **postdoctoral researcher** at the Department of Mathematics. Here, I was working in the MPM at the first time for studying the numerical simulation of structures subjected to extreme natural phenomena.

Finally I would also like to mention a **personal project** to which I dedicate my free time. I would like to point out that the gender gap in science, and in particular in engineering, is a fact today, as indicated by the [United Nations](https://www.un.org/en/un-chronicle/lack-gender-equality-science-everyone%E2%80%99s-problem#:~:text=According to%20UNESCO%20Science%20the%20percentage%20could%20be%20much%20higher%20). I believe that the **visibility** of historical women scientists is an important point to encourage girls to pursue careers in science, and in particular in engineering and mathematics. To this end, I manage the  instagram account named [Señoras de Ciencia](https://www.instagram.com/senyorasciencia/) (in spanish, sorry) with a lot of love, although I invest less time on it than I would like to.
