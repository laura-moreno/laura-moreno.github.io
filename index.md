Hello! I guess if you're here you must be interested to know who I am (or not, and you're here by mistake, in which case I'm very sorry).

Currently, I'm a **postdoctoral researcher** at [the Institut für Statik und Dynamik](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/isd) in the Technical University of Braunschweig (TUBS), in Germany.
<!-- I'm also part of thel Resarch Training Group [ GRK 2075](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/grk-2075).   -->
**My research** here is focused on the Material Point Method (MPM), a kind of particle method particularly suitable for simulating large deformation problems. This method is very useful for simulating multiphysics scenarios related with catastrophic water events, a topic in which I am strongly interested. It allows us to take preventive measures in advance and, consequently, to avoid damage in civil structures such as bridges and damns (and, in the most dramatic case, to avoid loss of human lifes).

<!-- All my developments are implemented in the open-source and parallelized high performance environment [Kratos Multiphysics](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics) code. -->

Although my research is mostly in enginering... I am not an engineer.
Some years ago I studied mathematics in the University of Alicante, in Spain. After finishing the degree, I was a very entusiastic mathematician with the wish of specialising in applied mathematics and learn techniques that were directly useful for other branches of science, like engineering, biology and industry in general. So I got an additional **Master in Industrial Mathematics** which gave me both the expertise on mathematical modelization for the numerical simulation of several physical phenomena.

<!--, by the University of Santiago de Compostela, also in Spain-->

Some months later, in September 2016 I started as **doctoral student** in the Technical University of Catalunya (UPC). During my PhD I worked on the development of mathematical models and numerical methods to simulate viscoelastic flows with high elasticity, a very challenging topic because numerical methods break down when the elasticity of the fluid flow increases.  It was a challenge for me to tackle this problem, but I think that I do my bit.

<!-- Finally, I presented [my thesis](https://www.tdx.cat/handle/10803/672679#page=1) on September 2021. -->

Then I moved to the University of Padua (UNIPD), in Italy, as a **postdoctoral researcher** at the Department of Mathematics. I was working in particle-based methods (in particular in the Material Point Method) for the simulation of structures subjected to extreme natural phenomena due to climate change. Definitely, this step led me to a new and fascinating scientific field of research in which I could study realistic situations. In particular, I focused on the development and implementation of techniques of stabilization for simulating incompressible materials in solid and fluid mechanics problems, using the implicit MPM.

That's about it as far as my professional career is concerned.

But... I would also like to mention a **personal project** to which I dedicate my free time. I would like to point out that the gender gap in science, and in particular in engineering, is a fact today, as indicated by the [United Nations](https://www.un.org/en/un-chronicle/lack-gender-equality-science-everyone%E2%80%99s-problem#:~:text=According to%20UNESCO%20Science%20the%20percentage%20could%20be%20much%20higher%20).
Although it is known that action needs to be taken at different levels, I believe that the visibility of historical women scientists is an important point to encourage girls to pursue careers in science, and in particular in engineering and mathematics.
To this end, I manage the  instagram account named [Señoras de Ciencia](https://www.instagram.com/senyorasciencia/) (in spanish, sorry) with a lot of love, although I invest less time on it than I would like to.
