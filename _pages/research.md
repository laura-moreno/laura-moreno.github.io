## Material Point Method


Currently, I'm developing new stabilized algorithms for incompressible materials. All the implementations were done in [Kratos Multiphysics](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics), a open-source code prepared for running multiphysics problems written in C++ and Python.

## Viscoelastic fluid flow with high elasticity

Talk about the main lines addressed in my doctoral thesis.
