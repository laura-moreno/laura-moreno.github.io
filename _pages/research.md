# Research

**In construction. Sorry for the inconvenience!**


## Material Point Method

Currently, I'm developing new stabilized algorithms for incompressible materials. All the implementations were done in [Kratos Multiphysics](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics), a open-source code prepared for running multiphysics problems written in C++ and Python.

## Viscoelastic fluid flow with high elasticity

Main lines addressed in my doctoral thesis.
