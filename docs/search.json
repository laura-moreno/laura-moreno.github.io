    "text": "Computational fluid dynamics\n\nNumerical simulations of viscoelastic fluid flow with high elasticity\nThe global goal of my thesis was the development of mathematical models and numerical methods to simulate viscoelastic flows with high elasticity using the Finite Element Method. The equations that modelized the viscoelastic fluid flow present a large number of non-linearities and additionally, when the elasticity of the fluid is dominant respect to the convection forces, new instabilities must be treated. Reproducing it accurately is considered one of the biggest challenges in computational rheology, as classical methods fails to reproduce high elasticity levels.\n\n\nOther projects in fluid dynamics\n\nNumerical analysis of the aerodynamic loads on a tunnel wall separation\nIn this project we study the influence of a telescope over another one concerning the optical parameters. To carry out the study, we solved the Navier Stokes equations on real terrain taking into account the temperature and considering the Smagorinsky model to capture the turbulence. And then we calculated the optical parameters that were influenced by the air temperature.\n\n\nNumerical analysis of the optical quality over a telescope\nEvaluation of the aerodynamic loads at the end of the constructed sections caused by the transient flows due to the train motion along the Mont-Royal tunnel. We carried out a CFD simulation using moving domains, where the geometry of the tunnel was fixed while the train was moving inside it. We used an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian strategy, solving the Navier Stokes equations considering this motion."
