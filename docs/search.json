    "text": "Computational fluid dynamics\n\nNumerical simulations of viscoelastic fluid flow with high elasticity\nThe overarching goal of my thesis was to develop mathematical models and numerical methods to simulate viscoelastic flows with high elasticity using the Finite Element Method. The equations modeling viscoelastic fluid flow present numerous nonlinearities. Additionally, when the elasticity of the fluid dominates over the convective forces, new instabilities must be addressed. Accurately reproducing these conditions is considered one of the biggest challenges in computational rheology, as classical methods fail to capture high levels of elasticity.\n\n\nOther projects in fluid dynamics\n\nNumerical analysis of the optical quality over a telescope\nIn this project, we studied the influence of one telescope on another concerning optical parameters. To conduct the study, we solved the Navier-Stokes equations on real terrain, accounting for temperature and using the Smagorinsky model to capture turbulence. We then calculated the optical parameters influenced by the air temperature.\n\n\nNumerical analysis of the aerodynamic loads on a tunnel wall separation\nWe evaluated the aerodynamic loads at the ends of constructed sections caused by transient flows due to train motion along the Mont-Royal tunnel. We conducted a CFD simulation using moving domains, where the tunnel geometry remained fixed while the train moved inside it. We employed an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian strategy, solving the Navier-Stokes equations to account for this motion."

This method is commonly used in automotive factories to detect fractures in crankshafts using fluorescent metal shavings."

    "text": "Hello! I’m an Assistant Professor in the Department of Applied Mathematics at the University of Alicante (UA), in Spain.\nMy research focuses on advancing the Material Point Method (MPM), a particle-based technique ideal for tackling large deformation problems in solid and fluid mechanics. This method has proven invaluable for simulating phenomena such as granular flows, landslides, and avalanches. Notably, MPM was employed to recreate the stunning snow effects in Disney’s Frozen animation.\nAlthough my current research primarily focuses on engineering applications, I am not an engineer by training.\nI began my academic journey studying Mathematics at the University of Alicante in Spain. Motivated by a passion for applied mathematics, I pursued a Master’s degree specializing in mathematical modeling for the numerical simulation of physical phenomena. During my PhD at the Technical University of Catalunya (UPC), my research centered on developing mathematical models to simulate highly elastic viscoelastic flows. After completing my doctorate, I joined the Department of Mathematics at the University of Padua in Italy as a postdoctoral researcher. There, I transitioned to working with the Material Point Method (MPM) to simulate the behavior of structures under extreme natural phenomena. Later, I continued this line of research at the Institut für Statik und Dynamik at the Technical University of Braunschweig (TUBS) in Germany.\nAs an educator, I aim to inspire curiosity and foster critical thinking among my students. I teach calculus courses tailored to various engineering disciplines, including aerospace, telecommunications, architecture, and robotics. My approach emphasizes connecting theoretical concepts with practical applications, helping students see mathematics as a powerful tool for solving real-world challenges.\n\n\nIn addition to my academic and teaching work, I am an active member of the Kratos Multiphysics community, where I contribute as a developer. Kratos is an open-source simulation software, written in C++ and Python, that focuses on advanced computational mechanics, and I am proud to be involved in its ongoing development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepartamento de Matemática Aplicada (Escuela Politécnica Superior),\nCtra.
