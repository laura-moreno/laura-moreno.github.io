    "text": "Computational fluid dynamics\n\nNumerical simulations of viscoelastic fluid flow with high elasticity\nThe overarching goal of my thesis was to develop mathematical models and numerical methods to simulate viscoelastic flows with high elasticity using the Finite Element Method. The equations modeling viscoelastic fluid flow present numerous nonlinearities. Additionally, when the elasticity of the fluid dominates over the convective forces, new instabilities must be addressed. Accurately reproducing these conditions is considered one of the biggest challenges in computational rheology, as classical methods fail to capture high levels of elasticity.\n\n\nOther projects in fluid dynamics\n\nNumerical analysis of the aerodynamic loads on a tunnel wall separation\nIn this project, we studied the influence of one telescope on another concerning optical parameters. To conduct the study, we solved the Navier-Stokes equations on real terrain, accounting for temperature and using the Smagorinsky model to capture turbulence. We then calculated the optical parameters influenced by the air temperature.\n\n\nNumerical analysis of the optical quality over a telescope\nWe evaluated the aerodynamic loads at the ends of constructed sections caused by transient flows due to train motion along the Mont-Royal tunnel. We conducted a CFD simulation using moving domains, where the tunnel geometry remained fixed while the train moved inside it. We employed an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian strategy, solving the Navier-Stokes equations to account for this motion."

    "text": "Hello! I’m a postdoctoral researcher at the Institut für Statik und Dynamik in the Technical University of Braunschweig (TUBS), in Germany. \nMy research focuses on the development of the Material Point Method (MPM), a particle method useful for solving large deformation problems in solid and fluid mechanics, such as the simulation of granular flows, landslides, and avalanches. In fact, this technique was used to reproduce the snow in the animation for the Frozen movie.\nAlthough my current research is primarily in engineering, I am not an engineer.\nA few years ago, I studied mathematics at the University of Alicante in Spain. After completing my degree, I was an enthusiastic mathematician eager to specialize in applied mathematics. I pursued an additional Master’s degree, which equipped me with expertise in mathematical modeling for the numerical simulation of physical phenomena. During my PhD at the Technical University of Catalunya (UPC), I worked on developing mathematical models to simulate viscoelastic flows with high elasticity. Then I moved to the Department of Mathematics at the University of Padua in Italy as a postdoctoral researcher. There, I began working with MPM to study the numerical simulation of structures subjected to extreme natural phenomena.\nI am also part of the Kratos Multiphysics community as developer. Kratos is an open-source simulation software written in C++ and Python."
